# Auto-HealthPlan

Auto-HealthPlan is a simple application that helps users create a personalized health plan based on their weight, height, age, sex, and exercise intensity. This project aims to make it easier for users to determine their caloric needs for weight gain or weight loss by providing a clear breakdown of macronutrient recommendations.

## Update: GUI and Executable Release

As of today's update, the application now includes a Graphical User Interface (GUI) for improved usability. The GUI makes it easier for users to input their information and view the results.

Additionally, we have released an executable version of Auto-HealthPlan for Windows. This allows users to run the application without installing Python or any dependencies.

## Features

- Easy-to-use GUI for inputting personal information
- Calculates BMI (Body Mass Index)
- Determines caloric intake for weight gain and weight loss
- Provides macronutrient breakdown (protein, fat, and carbs) for both weight gain and weight loss plans

## How to Use

1. Download the latest executable release for your platform (currently available for Windows).
2. Launch the application by double-clicking the executable file.
3. Input your weight (kg), height (cm), age, exercise intensity (无/久坐/低/中/高), and sex (男/女) into the corresponding fields.
4. Click the "Calculate" button to generate your personalized health plan.

## Future Improvements

- Add support for additional platforms (macOS and Linux)
- Localize the application for other languages
- Implement additional features, such as meal planning and exercise suggestions
